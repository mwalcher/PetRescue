	"description": "Pilsner is a quiet, smart, reserved dog. It takes time to earn her trust but once she bonds with you she will wag her tail and run to greet you when you come home. She loves to cuddle and will stick close to you during a thunderstorm. When we go for walks she will greet other dogs and people. She really needs a family who will be around most of the time. She thrives on consistent routine and company. She isn't really clingy; she just needs to have people around to make her the most comfortable. If you have been looking for a beautiful, friendly dog to call your new best friend look no further than Pilsner. She has a few special needs, but that does not stop her from enjoying life to the fullest. If you have a flexible schedule and enjoy a calm, relaxed lifestyle Pilsner could be the dog of your dreams!",

Prospero is looking for someone to teach him how to trust new people and places. Once he trusts you, he'll be sure to lean into you and ask for pets. Long walks and exercise and lots of training would suit this guy to a tee. He needs some help learning to share but is beaming with intelligence and ready to turn a new leaf. Prospero is a clever boy and knows sit, paw, high five, lie down, stay and roll over. Do you have room in your heart and home for this bouncy pup?",

	"description": "Ranger (called Bear by his current owners) is looking for a new home. He's an incredibly intelligent dog with an aptitude for clicker training. He already knows all his basic commands as well as a few tricks. He likes running and slashing in water and is working on learning how to swim. He loves playing the recall game and loves playing tug of war. He is great on leash but can get startled easily on his walks. However, when he gets scared he can easily be distracted with treats. Ranger is a very social fella who loves playing with other dogs during both daycare and group walks, so long as he is supervised throughout his play dates. He loves his car rides and his indoor play time but also loves to just settle down at his owner's feet. As smart as Ranger is, he is also a bit overwhelmed in new situations. He will do best in a home with owners who are committed to gradual socialization and non-confrontational introductions. He has the potential to get along with other dogs, but will require controlled and supervised interactions. Ranger's a playful, friendly boy who is looking for an owner who can provide daily physical and intellectual challenges. At the end of a long day, he'd be happy to cuddle with you while getting some neck scratches. If you're up for helping Ranger reach his potential, please speak with an adoption agent to learn the next steps.",

She is simultaneously majestic and adorable. Macey is also very strong, so potential adopters that are looking for an active dog should look no further. Macey is a very strong, sweet-natured, loyal companion. She is looking for someone who can not only keep up with her but also guide her along the way.

During playtime, he loves to tackle and swat at his mouse-on-a-rope and even chase his own tail but his favourite time of day is mealtime. During mealtime, he calmly tolerates his twice daily insulin injections.

She is ready to be the companion you've been waiting for. Gigi is a dreamer and, though you might think her cat antics a bit silly, you will grow to love her in time.

Recently, Mowsy has been spending time with children from a near by kindergarten class. She has realized that she loves children and desperately wants to play. On one of her many adventures, Mowsy managed to sneak away and took a stroll through the Dog Kennels, so it is safe to assume that she is not afraid of dogs.  We found her batting at Mr. Whisker’s wet nose and having a great time with her new friends.  You can meet Mowsy’s mother anytime: Shelby is now a resident cat in our Shelter Shop.
